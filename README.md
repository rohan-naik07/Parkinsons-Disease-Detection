# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection

## Overview

Worked on a Medical Computer Vision project involving Parkinson's Disease Detection by using Deep Learning,Keras and OpenCV on the images generated by the Spiral-Wave test.
Detected non-uniform patterns and distortions in handwriting through the Spiral-Wave tests and classified images as Parkinson's or Healthy.
Used **Random Forest Classifier** for Spiral images in the dataset and **KNN** for Wave images along with **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** for quantifying the images before training. Achieved **86.66%** accuracy for **Spiral** and **76.66%** accuracy for **Wave** images in the dataset
