# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection

## Overview

Worked on Parkinson's Disease Detection by using CNN,Keras and OpenCV on the images generated by the Spiral-Wave test.
Detected non-uniform patterns in the Spiral-Wave tests and classified images as Parkinson or Healthy.
Used **Random Forest Classifier** for Spiral images in the dataset and **KNN** for Wave images along with **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** for training the images. Achieved
